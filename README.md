# Cope Notes Email App Frontend

This is the frontend user interface (UI) for a coding challenge. To use this UI in development:

1. Install dependencies with `npm ci`
2. Make sure the [backend API](https://github.com/JessieFrance/cope-notes-email-app) is running (please see instructions at that link)
3. Start the application with `npm start`

You can also run tests with `npm test`, and build the application for production with `npm run build`.
